It's going to be partly cloudy all through the morning and afternoon with temperatures of High 88F by the afternoon. Some clouds early will give way to generally clear conditions overnight with temperatures reaching Low around 70F. It's also International Coffee Day so don't forget that most places are giving away free coffee or at a discounted price. Support Local!
